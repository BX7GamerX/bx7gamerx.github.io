        <p>
            This section introduces the learner to what to expect when tacking the long course and what is expected of them as they take the course. it gives the grips of the concepts tackled later in the course and alike
            This section tackles:
        <ol>
            <li>Introduction to programming  learn intro to C++, python, java, Kotlin, C#;</li>
            <li>Introduction to software development  create own desktop and mobile app.</li>
            <li>Introduction to web development-create dynamic web pages and apps</li>
            <li>Introduction to computers and the family brief into how computers work</li>
            <li>Introduction to operating systemsdifferent O/S s and how they work n use them</li>
            <li>How to use related software (IDEs etc.)what are they and how to use them</li>

        <p> This being the main course we will dive in to computer science tackling form as mundane concepts as
            ethics to as ronuse as Artificial Intelligence. and the order of study will be :
        <h3>Overview of Concepts Discussed:</h3>
        <h2>We will firstly cover the <span>Mathematical</span> part need to understand
            the pretty advanced concepts in our preliminary chapter and that includes:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mathematical Foundation for Computer Science</li>
            <li>Linear Algebra for Computer Science</li>

            <li>Calculus I & II</li>
            <li>Probability and Statistics for Computer Science</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>We shall then dive in to the <span>computational</span> concepts in the order:</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Computer Fundamentals                about how computers work</li>

        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>
            In this book I will provide the needed guidance to becoming the
            programmer that I am. Most of it entails things you are
            probably family with intertwined in ways in may never see again,
            but that is just how I thought would work on any person learning
            computer science on their own would appreciate. The first volume
            pretty much lays out the ground of what we will need; the second
            volume for the quick spread run of the entire course that se to
            cover the basics and all the fundamentals of the course that way
            any learner , by the end of the volume i.e. will be in position
            to know what to expect in the third volume which will dive into
            the already mentioned concepts(concepts discussed in the second volume)
            but in details this time with aim of fully quipping the e learner with
            the needed knowledge to tackle ant problem as need. Finally, will do a
            recap of everything in chapter four where core concepts will be repeated. These are the most essential   concepts needed by any programmer out there.
